## 🧾 Real-life Example: Doctor Form

Imagine you go to a doctor’s clinic. You fill this form:

```
Name:        ______
Age:         ______
```

Let’s say your current info is:

```js
user = {
  name: "Kishore",
  age: 20
}
```

Now you only want to change the **name**, not the age.

### 🧠 In React:

```js
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "", age: 0 });
```

✅ `user` is like your **form**  
✅ `setUser` is like **editing the form**

---

## ❌ WRONG way:

If you do this:

```js
setUser({ name: "Ram" });
```

Now the user becomes:

```js
user = { name: "Ram" }  ❌
```

🎯 Oops! Age is gone now!

---

## ✅ RIGHT way:

We use this:

```js
setUser({ ...user, name: "Ram" });
```

This means:

> "Take everything from the old form (name, age...) and **just change the name**."

It becomes:

```js
setUser({
  name: "Ram",  // new name
  age: 20       // still safe!
});
```

## 🧪 Breakdown of `...user`

If:
```js
user = { name: "Kishore", age: 20 }
```

Then:
```js
...user = name: "Kishore", age: 20
```

So:
```js
{ ...user, name: "Ram" }
➡ becomes: { name: "Ram", age: 20 }
```

It **keeps age** and **changes name only** 💪

---

## 🔄 So, in code:

```jsx
<input onChange={(e) => setUser({ ...user, name: e.target.value })} />
```

- `e.target.value` = what the user typed  
- `setUser(...)` updates only `name`, keeps the rest
